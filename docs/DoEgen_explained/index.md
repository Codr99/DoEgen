# Tutorial: DoEgen

`DoEgen` is a Python tool designed to help researchers with **Design of Experiments (DoE)**.
It *automates* the creation of efficient experimental plans (*design generation*), helps evaluate how *good* these plans are (*design evaluation*), and suggests the best plans to use (*design selection*).
After running the experiments, `DoEgen` can take the results, combine them with the plan, and perform *statistical analysis* and create *visualizations* to understand which factors are most important and what settings yield the best outcomes.
It uses simple Excel templates for defining experiments and inputting results, and YAML files for configuration.
